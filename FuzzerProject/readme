Fuzzer Project deliverables

Submit a .zip file through UCF Canvas. The zip file should contain:
1. Source code file of your fuzzer. You can include multiple fuzzer codes where each of them is used to discover 
   one or several specific bugs. 
2. The input files (modified jpg images based on the sample.jpg) that could trigger each of the bugs you can find. 
   For each bug, just provide one input image file. Name the input file as “test-x.jpg” for Bug # x. 
   In this way, I can easily check whether you really found Bug #x by running it by myself! 
3. A 3-5 page project report (in PDF).
